### An attempt at learning how to make applications using JavaScript.
#### By Asma Adan
##### Learning JavaScript at Moringa School prep requires the setting up of an application using HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
##### This particular  application allow the user to do a quiz online, submit it and then be informed how they performed.  
##### The application also the tells the user how they did on the test, how many corect answers they got and the way forward.
##### You can take a look at it and let me know any changes I should make or any suggestions you maybe having or how I should make my 

functions better and make the website more appealing. Thank you in advance.
## BDD
#### Want to test how I did this project?
##### Here are the specs:

*The program should return when all the questions are not answered

    Input:nothing

    Output: please answer all the questions

*The program should tell the user is required to fill in their details for:

    Name:
    
    Email:

    Date:

*The Program allows the user to make only one choice among three choices, it does not accept 2 choices

*The Program assigns +1 when the answer is correct and a +0 when the answer is wrong.
   
*The Program then adds up all the answers and gives the user a grade.
